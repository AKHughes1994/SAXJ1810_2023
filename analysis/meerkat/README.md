By default this directory is empty due to the size of the images (~1 GB) these cannot be uploaded to GitHub. The images can be made using the recipe "oxkat" after downloading the the SARAO archive.

Moreover, the directory titled astrometry has all of the files the AstKAT routine which qauntifies the astrometric precision for time-domain MeerKAT fields. This also requires the images, so instead I have just copied the final results into the astrometry directory.
