# SAXJ1810_2023
GitHub Repo that contains the plotting scripts for the 2023 MeerKAT/Swift-XRT analysis of SAX J1810

The `figures` directory contains all of the scripts for plotting.

The `analysis` directory contains all of the results and the data analysis and plotting scripts. 

This should be complete, and you should be able to download the directory and run each of the scripts without any fuss. If you have any issues or if anything is missing, feel free to email me at hugheaskh@gmail.com, and we can sort out the problems.
